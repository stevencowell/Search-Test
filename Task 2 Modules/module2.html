    <h2>Using Construction and Carpentry Power Tools</h2>
    <p><em>Units: CPCCCM2005 ‚Äì Use construction tools and equipment<br>
    CPCCCA2002 ‚Äì Use carpentry tools and equipment</em></p>

    <h3>üîπ General Power Tool Safety Principles</h3>
    <p>Power tools are indispensable on a construction site but can cause serious injury if misused.  The following principles apply to all powered equipment:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inspect before use</strong> ‚Äì Check cords, plugs, casings and guards for damage.  Never use a tool if it is defective or missing guards.</li>
      <li><strong>Use the right tool for the job</strong> ‚Äì Match the tool and accessory to the material and task.  Do not modify tools or use them for purposes for which they were not designed.</li>
      <li><strong>Protect against electric shock</strong> ‚Äì Hand‚Äëheld electric power tools and portable equipment must be protected by a residual current device (RCD) or safety switch.  Examples of equipment requiring RCD protection include drills, saws, grinders and electric jackhammers.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep leads off the ground</strong> ‚Äì Suspend extension leads on hooks or stands and keep them away from sharp edges, heat, water and vehicle traffic.  Do not overload power boards.</li>
      <li><strong>Wear appropriate personal protective equipment</strong> ‚Äì Eye protection, hearing protection, gloves, dust masks or respirators and sturdy footwear should be worn as required for the specific tool and material.</li>
      <li><strong>Disconnect power before adjustments</strong> ‚Äì Unplug the tool or remove the battery and allow moving parts to stop before changing blades, bits or discs or when clearing jams.</li>
      <li><strong>Secure the workpiece and maintain good posture</strong> ‚Äì Clamp or support the work firmly, keep a balanced stance and ensure others are kept clear of the work area.</li>
      <li><strong>Be trained and authorised</strong> ‚Äì Only trained and competent workers should operate high‚Äërisk tools such as nail guns, rotary hammer drills and jackhammers.  Follow the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions and any site‚Äëspecific safe work method statements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>üîπ Cutting and Shaping Power Tools</h3>
    <p><strong>Circular Saw</strong><br>
    Used for making fast, straight cuts in timber or plywood. Ensure your timber is clamped and free from obstructions before cutting. Always keep hands clear of the blade and tie back long hair. This saw must start from the edge or a pilot hole‚Äîit can‚Äôt do plunge cuts.</p>

    <p><strong>Sliding Compound Saw</strong><br>
    Ideal for cross-cutting timber to length at various angles (typically between 90¬∞ and 45¬∞). Accurate and fast. Keep fingers clear of the blade, clamp the timber securely, and use the dust extraction system where available.</p>

    <p><strong>Jigsaw</strong><br>
    Used for cutting curves or detailed shapes in timber or sheet materials. Can also make straight cuts but isn‚Äôt as precise. The blade is thin and flexible, so it may bend under pressure‚Äîavoid forcing it through dense material.</p>

    <p><strong>Reciprocating Saw</strong><br>
    Commonly used for demolition or rough cuts through wood, metal, PVC, and nails. The blade moves back and forth. It can be hard to control for precision work but is very effective for cutting in tight spaces. Keep cords clear of the work area.</p>

    <p><strong>Bench Grinder</strong><br>
    Used for sharpening metal tools like chisels and drill bits. Keep fingers well clear of the grinding wheel and always wear safety glasses and ear protection. Overheating the tool can damage the edge, so grind lightly and use water for cooling.</p>

    <h3>üîπ Drilling and Fastening Tools</h3>
    <p><strong>Cordless Drill</strong><br>
    A versatile tool for drilling holes and driving screws. Check the drill bit is secure before use. It‚Äôs ideal for lighter jobs‚Äîbe cautious of kickback if it jams. Always wear eye protection and don‚Äôt force the drill.</p>

    <p><strong>Impact Driver</strong><br>
    Designed for high-torque screwdriving tasks, especially where heavy-duty screws or bolts are involved. More powerful than a standard drill but lacks torque control, so it can overdrive or snap screws if not used carefully.</p>

    <p><strong>Rotary Hammer Drill</strong><br>
    Used to drill into concrete or brick. Has a hammering function that helps break through tough materials. Check walls for hidden electrical cables before starting and wear full PPE including eye and ear protection.</p>

    <p><strong>Nail Gun</strong><br>
    Drives nails quickly and accurately, often used for framing or fixing. Always check the safety catch is working and never point the tool at anyone. Only fire when in contact with the work surface. Keep others clear of the line of fire.</p>

    <h3>üîπ Shaping and Surface Preparation Tools</h3>
    <p><strong>Power Planer</strong><br>
    Used to trim framing timber and even out high spots in studs or joists. Must be set to a shallow depth and passed evenly along the grain. Can kick back if overloaded. Clamp your timber before using.</p>

    <p><strong>Laminate Trimmer / Router</strong><br>
    Used for decorative edge treatments, trenching, and shaping. Requires special bits for different tasks. Always secure your work and unplug when changing bits. Use both hands and move steadily to avoid tear-out.</p>

    <p><strong>Angle Grinder</strong><br>
    Cuts, grinds, or polishes metal and masonry using different discs. Dangerous if mishandled‚Äîcheck the disc is tight and guard is in place. Always wear full PPE and keep the tool away from flammable materials.</p>

    <h3>üîπ Power and Safety Accessories</h3>
    <p><strong>Portable Residual Current Device (RCD)</strong><br>
    Protects against electric shock by cutting off power if a fault is detected. Must be tested regularly. Will not detect all types of faults‚Äîused as a supplement to safe practice, not a replacement.</p>

    <p><strong>Extension Lead</strong><br>
    Used when equipment can‚Äôt reach a power outlet. Should be suspended using lead stands to keep it off the ground and out of harm‚Äôs way. Must be tagged, tested, and in good condition.</p>

    <p><strong>Air Compressor</strong><br>
    Powers pneumatic tools like nail guns. Check hoses for leaks, set correct pressure for the tool, and release pressure after use. Can be noisy‚Äîwear hearing protection.</p>

    <p><strong>Jack Hammer</strong><br>
    Used for heavy demolition work like breaking concrete or removing tiles. Requires strength and control. Always wear full PPE including gloves, boots, ear, and eye protection.</p>
