    <h2>Practical Use of Hand Tools</h2>
    <p><em>Units: CPCCCM2005 ‚Äì Use construction tools and equipment<br>
    CPCCCA2002 ‚Äì Use carpentry tools and equipment</em></p>

    <p>Developing practical skills with hand tools is essential. Students are expected to <strong>select the appropriate hand tool for each task and use it safely and effectively</strong>. This means applying the knowledge of which tool to use (from Module¬†1) and the correct method of using it as practised in class. Key points for the practical use of hand tools include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Use each required hand tool at least once across your projects:</strong> Over the course of at least three practical tasks or projects, you will need to demonstrate the ability to safely and effectively use all of the common hand tools in the toolkit. This includes measuring and marking tools (tape measures, rules, squares, chalk lines), cutting tools (hand saws, coping saws, tin snips, knives), striking tools (hammers, mallets), boring tools (hand drill or brace if applicable), and others like chisels, planes, clamps, shovels, mattocks, crowbars, etc. Ensure you get hands-on practice with each tool in a controlled and correct manner. (Your instructor may set specific tasks to make sure you use each tool.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Follow all WHS requirements and manufacturers‚Äô recommendations when using hand tools:</strong> Even though hand tools are manually operated, they can still cause injuries if used improperly. Always use the correct personal protective equipment (e.g., wear safety glasses when chiselling or hammering in case of flying chips). Use each tool <strong>only for its intended purpose</strong> and within its limitations ‚Äì for example, do not use a screwdriver as a chisel or a chisel as a screwdriver, and do not hammer on a tool not meant for striking. Keep hands and body parts out of the line of fire (for instance, when chiselling or cutting, position your body and supporting hand so that if the tool slips, it won‚Äôt hit you). If a tool has a manufacturer‚Äôs guideline (like a maximum torque for a hand wrench or specific sharpening angle for a plane blade), follow those instructions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Apply proper technique as demonstrated:</strong> For each hand tool, there is a correct way to hold and use it. During practical sessions, pay attention to your teacher‚Äôs demonstrations and feedback on technique. For example, when using a hand saw, start the cut with a gentle draw action to create a groove, then use long, even strokes without excessive force. When using a chisel, ensure the material is secured and cut away from yourself, tapping the chisel with controlled strikes of a mallet. Using clamps, ensure they are tight but not over-tightened to avoid damaging the material. These techniques help you work efficiently and safely, and also produce quality workmanship.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tool maintenance during use:</strong> Part of practical use is keeping your tools in good working order. If a hand tool becomes dull or damaged during use (for example, a saw blade dulls, or a chisel edge chips), stop and address the issue ‚Äì sharpen the tool or inform the instructor if a replacement is needed. Do not force a dull tool to work, as this often leads to accidents. Wipe down tools after use, especially cutting edges, to keep them clean for the next use.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Work efficiently and safely:</strong> Plan your work when using hand tools just as you would with power tools. Use measuring and marking tools to mark out cuts accurately <em>before</em> cutting ‚Äì ‚Äúmeasure twice, cut once.‚Äù Secure your workpiece with clamps or a vice so it doesn‚Äôt slip. Be mindful of the people around you; maintain a safe distance so that, for instance, if you are swinging a hammer or mattock, no one is in range of the swing. Communicate with your teammates when you are about to do something that might affect them (like hammering or prying, to avoid surprise movements).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>üîπ Working with Measuring and Marking Tools</h3>
    <p><strong>Retractable Tape Measure</strong><br>
    Use this for marking out timber lengths and dimensions. Extend the tape slowly and hold it steady when measuring. Avoid letting it snap back.</p>

    <p><strong>Builder‚Äôs Square &amp; Combination Square</strong><br>
    Used to check and mark right angles (90¬∞) and 45¬∞ mitres. The combination square can also measure depth and centre points. Align carefully and mark using a sharp pencil or knife.</p>

    <p><strong>String Line &amp; Chalk Line</strong><br>
    These help align posts or mark long, straight lines across surfaces. Secure each end tightly and snap the line firmly to mark. Always tidy up and rewind lines to prevent tangling.</p>

    <p><strong>Spirit Level</strong><br>
    Place the level against your work to ensure it's horizontally or vertically aligned. Wait for the bubble to settle. Don‚Äôt rely on guesswork‚Äîthis tool is essential for structural accuracy.</p>

    <h3>üîπ Using Cutting and Shaping Tools</h3>
    <p><strong>Handsaw</strong><br>
    Mark your line before cutting. Secure timber with clamps or in a vice. Start with a short, controlled backstroke to create a groove, then saw with steady rhythm. Keep the saw perpendicular to your work.</p>

    <p><strong>Coping Saw</strong><br>
    Ideal for internal curves or cut-outs. Light pressure and gentle turning will keep the blade from twisting or snapping. Good for thinner ply or decorative work.</p>

    <p><strong>Chisel</strong><br>
    Used to clean out joints or create housings. Always chisel away from your body, and hold the handle securely. Use a mallet (not a hammer) to apply controlled force. Keep the edge sharp.</p>

    <p><strong>Hand Plane</strong><br>
    Push the plane along the grain in smooth strokes. Set the blade depth properly before beginning. Used to flatten, straighten, or thin timber surfaces.</p>

    <h3>üîπ Assembly and Holding Tools</h3>
    <p><strong>Claw Hammer</strong><br>
    Grip the hammer near the end of the handle. Drive nails in straight with firm, controlled strikes. When removing nails, use the curved claw and brace against the timber to avoid damage.</p>

    <p><strong>Trimming Knife</strong><br>
    Only extend the blade slightly beyond the cutting depth needed. Cut on a stable surface and away from yourself. Replace dull blades immediately.</p>

    <p><strong>Clamps</strong><br>
    Used to hold workpieces during sawing, chiselling, or gluing. Choose the right clamp type and avoid overtightening. Position to keep work stable without blocking your cutting line.</p>

    <h3>üîπ General Safety and Technique</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Always check the tool before use</strong> ‚Äì make sure it‚Äôs clean, sharp, and undamaged.</li>
      <li><strong>Use proper body positioning</strong> ‚Äì don‚Äôt overreach or lean across materials.</li>
      <li><strong>Work at bench height</strong> ‚Äì avoid working on the floor to protect posture.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep your tools close and organised</strong> ‚Äì avoids unnecessary movement and distraction.</li>
      <li><strong>Communicate if unsure</strong> ‚Äì don‚Äôt guess; ask for clarification during observation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By practising with hand tools under these guidelines, you will build competence and confidence. The goal is to be able to independently perform all necessary tasks using the correct hand tools, in a safe manner and to the required standard of workmanship.</p>

    <p><em>Remember: proficiency with hand tools is a foundational skill in construction. It trains you to work with precision and care, which will also benefit your use of power tools.</em></p>
