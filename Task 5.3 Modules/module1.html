    <h2>Australian Standards (AS) in Joinery</h2>
    <p>Australian Standards are documents that set out specifications and procedures to ensure products and services are safe, reliable, and consistent. In joinery, they are critical for safety and quality.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AS 1473.2—2001 (Wood processing machinery—Safety):</strong> This is a key safety standard. Its main goal is to protect operators by specifying requirements for machine guarding, identifying hazards (mechanical and non-mechanical), and outlining risk control measures.</li>
        <li><strong>AS 4386 Series (Cabinetry & Kitchen Assemblies):</strong> This series provides the minimum requirements for the manufacture and installation of domestic kitchens and other built-in furniture to ensure they are fit for purpose.</li>
        <li><strong>AS/NZS 2754.1:2016 (Adhesives for timber):</strong> Specifies requirements for adhesives used to manufacture plywood and Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL), ensuring they create strong, durable bonds.</li>
        <li><strong>AS 1859.1:2017 (Reconstituted wood-based panels):</strong> Sets the performance requirements for materials like particleboard and MDF, ensuring their quality and suitability for use.</li>
        <li><strong>AS 1684.2:2021 (Residential timber-framed construction):</strong> This standard outlines the building practices for timber frames, including the selection and fixing of structural elements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Workplace Safety Documents</h2>
    <p>These documents are used to manage safety on site in a systematic way.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Job Safety Analysis (JSA):</strong> A process to identify hazards and control measures for general construction tasks. It breaks a job down into steps, identifies the hazards at each step, and lists the controls to keep workers safe.</li>
        <li><strong>Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS):</strong> A legal requirement for any "High Risk Construction Work" (HRCW). It is more detailed than a JSA and must be prepared before any high-risk work begins.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety Data Sheet (SDS):</strong> Provides essential health and safety information for any hazardous chemical or substance used on site. It includes details on health hazards, first aid, PPE requirements, and safe handling procedures.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Quality Control in Joinery</h2>
    <p>Quality control ensures that the final product meets the required specifications and standards.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Quality Assurance:</strong> The overall system of processes and procedures used to prevent defects before they happen. It's about having a good plan.</li>
        <li><strong>Quality Control:</strong> The process of inspecting and testing the product during and after manufacturing to find and fix any defects. It's about checking the work.</li>
        <li><strong>Quality Improvement:</strong> The process of analysing the results of quality control checks to make the quality assurance system even better in the future.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Environmental Management</h2>
    <p>Workplaces must manage their environmental impact. The <strong>Environment Protection Authority (EPA)</strong> is the main regulator in NSW.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Key Considerations:</strong> Workplaces must manage waste disposal, stormwater runoff to prevent pollution, and noise levels to avoid disturbing neighbours.</li>
        <li><strong>Resource Efficiency:</strong> This involves using sustainable materials, minimising energy use, reducing waste, and creating durable products that can be recycled.</li>
