    <h2>Understanding Knock-Down (KD) Fittings</h2>
    <p>Knock-down fittings are pre-fabricated connectors that allow furniture and joinery to be assembled and disassembled easily. They are essential for flat-pack furniture.</p>

    <div class="fitting-section">
      <h3>Cam-Lock Fitting</h3>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> A two-part fitting consisting of a cam (a round disc with a spiral slot) and a dowel with a head. When the cam is turned with a screwdriver, it pulls the dowel in, tightening the joint. It's a concealed fixing ideal for securing two perpendicular pieces.</p>
      <p><strong>Common Use:</strong> The primary fitting used in flat-pack cabinets, cupboards, and shelving units.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="fitting-section">
      <h3>Cross Dowel (or Joint Connector Nut) and Bolt</h3>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> A cylindrical metal nut (the cross dowel) is inserted into a hole drilled in one piece of timber. A bolt is then passed through a hole in the second piece and screwed into the cross dowel, pulling the two pieces together.</p>
      <p><strong>Common Use:</strong> Bed frames, tables, and other furniture requiring a strong, right-angled joint that can be disassembled.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="fitting-section">
      <h3>Insert Nut and Bolt</h3>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> An insert nut is a threaded sleeve that is screwed or pressed into a piece of timber, providing a strong, permanent machine thread. A bolt can then be used to attach another component.</p>
      <p><strong>Common Use:</strong> Attaching legs to tables or providing a strong fixing point in softwoods or particleboard.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="fitting-section">
      <h3>Concealed Hinge (or European Hinge)</h3>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> A hinge that is completely hidden from view when the cabinet door is closed. It requires a large hole (usually 35mm) to be drilled in the back of the door for the hinge "cup" to sit in.</p>
      <p><strong>Common Use:</strong> Virtually all modern kitchen and bathroom cabinet doors.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="fitting-section">
      <h3>Benchtop Connector (or Dog Bone Connector)</h3>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> A metal connector shaped like a dog bone with threaded ends. It sits in routed recesses on the underside of two benchtops and is tightened with nuts to pull the two sections together, creating a tight, seamless join.</p>
      <p><strong>Common Use:</strong> Joining kitchen benchtop sections to form an L-shaped or U-shaped benchtop.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Joinery Unit Assembly Processes</h2>
    <p>Different joinery units require different assembly methods and joints.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Multi-Panelled Door:</strong> Typically uses strong, traditional joints like <strong>mortice and tenons</strong> to connect the outer frame (stiles and rails). The inner panels then sit in a groove or rebate cut into the inside edge of the frame.</li>
      <li><strong>Door Frame and Jamb:</strong> The rough opening (door frame) in a wall is often made with simple <strong>butt joints</strong> and nails. The door jamb (the finished lining that the door hangs in) is then fitted inside this opening, often using <strong>housing or rebate joints</strong> at the corners and fixed in place with screws and packers (wedges).</li>
      <li><strong>Carcass Unit (Cupboard):</strong> The main box structure is typically assembled with simple <strong>butt joints</strong> and secured with screws or, more commonly, <strong>knock-down fittings</strong> like cam-locks. The back panel is often rebated or simply nailed on.</li>
    </ul>
